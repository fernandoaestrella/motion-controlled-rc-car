# Motion-Controlled-RC-Car

As part of a team of 2, modified a cheap RC toy car to be controlled by the angle in which a sensor was positioned, and transmitted that angle wirelessly.

The new hand held controller could be tilted in any of 4 different directions (forward, backwards, left and right) and the appropriate combinations, and the car would move in any of the resulting directions (it could move forward, backwards, forward and right, forward and left, back and right, back and left, turn the wheels right, or turn them left).
